need to set transferfloorlight with the script!

blood splashe things? Check R667...


do it so certain combinations allow to reach secrets (ony allow ONE to reach floor)

logic for nail puzzle:
----------------------
nails: E,W,S



platform secret puzzle:
W redbrick wall is stairs up to SECOND level of nail descent. This crosses oer to opposide wall - this will allow getitng on and crossing to E nail, wih goodies.

Skullkeys on platforms!
have fireblu switch to open bars on entry telespot
transfer walllight to switchs
final platform is W nail
final platform needs both keys (change to executewithlock)
control sector to raise SLOPING CONTROL SECTOR? To reveal a tunnel#
 - this will need portals

Also, need to script the key message as per
https://zdoom.org/wiki/ACS_LockedExecute
